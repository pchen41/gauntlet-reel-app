We are creating a tiktok clone app using flutter called ReelAI. This app will have the following features:

- Account creation and authentication using Firebase
- User profiles with bio, profile picture and a grid of their videos
- A feed of infinitely scrolling videos
- Each videos will allow users to like, comment, and share
- Allow the user to a video from their camera roll
- User should be taken to login screen on app launch if not logged in, otherwise they should be taken to the home screen (feed of videos)
- There should be a nav bar at the bottom that lets the user switch between the home screen (feed of videos), and the profile screen
